# Spire_Chatbot_Code
Spire Chatbot is an intelligent, document-aware conversational assistant built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It enables users to interact with enterprise documents stored in SharePoint by querying and receiving contextually accurate responses. The chatbot extracts and indexes content (including text and tables) from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, ODT) using Microsoft Graph API and Azure services. It leverages PySpark for data transformation and integrates with LLMs to provide natural language responses based on the retrieved document content. Designed to streamline knowledge access across organizations, Spire improves productivity and decision-making.
